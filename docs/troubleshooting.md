# Troubleshooting

## Basic Auth not working

Certain Apache configurations strip `Authorization` headers and don't allow the Basic Auth credentials to be made available to PHP. To get around this, you'll need to set an environment variable in the site's root `.htaccess` file:

```
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]
</IfModule>
```

*This __must__ be in the site root `.htaccess` (not the `wp-content/uploads/pixelgradelt-records-xxxx/.htaccess`), and it __must__ come before the WordPress rewrites.*

## Rewrite Rules

Some servers don't route URLs ending with a file extension through WordPress' front controller, so it's possible that some rewrite rules PixelgradeLT Records registers won't work. This primarily affects the route that delivers the `packages.json` file for Composer since it ends in `.json`. You will typically see a 404 error document generated by the server rather than a 404 page with your theme's design when this happens.

Try visiting the _Settings &rarr; Permalinks_ page and flushing the site's permalinks first if the URL for `packages.json` doesn't work. _[Rewrite Rules Inspector](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rewrite-rules-inspector/) is a handy plugin for viewing or flushing rewrite rules._

If that still doesn't work, you may need to add a rewrite rule to your server:

### Apache

An external rewrite rule should be automatically added to `.htaccess` to handle `packages.json`.

### nginx

`rewrite ^/ltpackagist/packages.json$ /index.php last;`
