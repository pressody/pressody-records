# PixelgradeLT Records Documentation

Define and manage PixelgradeLT parts and packages (plugins and themes) to be used on customers' websites. Also, provide a Composer repository for the defined WordPress plugins, themes and parts.

## Why a WordPress Installation?

Packages are exposed via a `packages.json` file for inclusion as a Composer repository in a project's `composer.json` or even your own `satis.json`.
