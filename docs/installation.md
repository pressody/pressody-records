# Installation

As a standard WordPress plugin, installation is the same as most other plugins. This can be done by uploading the plugin as a zip file, or using Composer.

PixelgradeLT Records requires PHP 7.4 or later.

## Zip File

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/pixelgradelt/pixelgradelt-records/releases/latest) from GitHub (use the asset named `pixelgradelt-records-{version}.zip`).
2. Go to the _Plugins &rarr; Add New_ screen in your WordPress admin panel and click the __Upload Plugin__ button at the top.
3. Upload the zipped archive.
4. Click the __Activate Plugin__ link after installation completes.

### Updates

[GitHub Updater](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater) can be used to receive notifications and install updates when new releases are available.

*__Note__: If you're using GitHub Updater to install PixelgradeLT Records, copy the full URL to the [latest release asset](https://github.com/pixelgradelt/pixelgradelt-records/releases/latest) (the asset named `pixelgradelt-records-{version}.zip`). Using the repository URL alone won't work.*
